## 1. Executive Summary

Gharinto is a technology-driven, three-sided marketplace designed to organize and streamline India's fragmented and often inefficient home interiors and renovation market. Positioned as a direct competitor to platforms like Livspace and HomeLane, Gharinto differentiates itself by focusing on the **value-conscious "essential" segment**â€”providing high-quality, transparent, and reliable interior solutions at an affordable price point.

Our platform will serve as a unified ecosystem connecting four key stakeholders: **Homeowners (Customers), Interior Designers (Partners), Material Suppliers/Manufacturers (Vendors), and Real Estate Developers (Builders).** By integrating a sophisticated project management suite, a curated e-commerce catalog, and transparent financial tools, Gharinto aims to solve the industry's core problems of cost overruns, project delays, lack of quality control, and poor communication.

This document outlines the vision, market positioning, functional requirements, technical architecture, and go-to-market strategy for the Gharinto platform. The initial development will focus on creating a Minimum Viable Platform (MVP) that validates the core user journey, followed by phased rollouts of advanced features to capture market share and scale operations.
