# **Gharinto: Product Requirements Document (PRD) & System Specification**

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Status:** Draft for Review
**Author:** AI Assistant (Refined from Prasad & Rohith's SRS)

## 1. Executive Summary

Gharinto is a technology-driven, three-sided marketplace designed to organize and streamline India's fragmented and often inefficient home interiors and renovation market. Positioned as a direct competitor to platforms like Livspace and HomeLane, Gharinto differentiates itself by focusing on the **value-conscious "essential" segment**â€”providing high-quality, transparent, and reliable interior solutions at an affordable price point.

Our platform will serve as a unified ecosystem connecting four key stakeholders: **Homeowners (Customers), Interior Designers (Partners), Material Suppliers/Manufacturers (Vendors), and Real Estate Developers (Builders).** By integrating a sophisticated project management suite, a curated e-commerce catalog, and transparent financial tools, Gharinto aims to solve the industry's core problems of cost overruns, project delays, lack of quality control, and poor communication.

This document outlines the vision, market positioning, functional requirements, technical architecture, and go-to-market strategy for the Gharinto platform. The initial development will focus on creating a Minimum Viable Platform (MVP) that validates the core user journey, followed by phased rollouts of advanced features to capture market share and scale operations.

## 2. The Market Opportunity & The Problem

The Indian home interiors market is a multi-billion dollar industry plagued by systemic inefficiencies. The experience for all stakeholders is broken, creating a significant opportunity for a technology-led solution.

### 2.1 The Problem: Stories from a Fragmented Ecosystem

Your original stories perfectly capture the pain points. Here they are, framed within the PRD:

*   **For the Homeowner (The Sharma Family):** The journey is a nightmare of opaque pricing, missed deadlines, inconsistent quality, and a complete lack of accountability. They feel powerless and frustrated, turning a dream project into a source of immense stress.
*   **For the Interior Designer (Priya):** Talent is wasted on administrative chaos. She struggles with unreliable cash flow, inefficient supply chains, and a constant search for dependable labor, limiting her creative output and business growth.
*   **For the Manufacturer ("Classic Furniture"):** Business is a "feast or famine" cycle. Inconsistent order flow from a small network of designers makes it impossible to manage inventory, staffing, and cash flow effectively, hindering scalability.
*   **For the Builder (Raj):** Unsold inventory is a major liability. Without the ability to offer attractive, move-in-ready solutions, properties are perceived as empty shells, leading to longer sales cycles and reduced property value.

### 2.2 The Solution: The Gharinto Unified Ecosystem

Gharinto is not just an app; it's a centralized platform that creates a symbiotic relationship between all stakeholders, turning their individual pain points into collective strengths.

| Stakeholder | How Gharinto Provides the Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Homeowners** | A transparent, one-stop platform offering 3D visualization, real-time project tracking, vetted professionals, quality-assured materials, and secure, milestone-based payments. **Peace of mind is the core product.** |
| **Interior Designers** | A complete business-in-a-box: a steady stream of qualified leads, powerful design and quoting tools, a curated e-commerce catalog, and guaranteed, timely payments via a digital wallet. **We empower them to be creators, not managers.** |
| **Manufacturers/Vendors** | Access to a broad, aggregated market with consistent order flow, predictable demand forecasting, and streamlined, secure payment processing. **We offer stability and a clear path to growth.** |
| **Builders** | A powerful value-added service to offer buyers. By integrating Gharinto's pre-designed packages, they can market "fully-furnished" homes, accelerate sales, and increase property valuation. **We turn their properties into homes.** |

## 3. User Personas & System Portals

The Gharinto platform will be composed of distinct but interconnected portals, each tailored to the needs of its primary user.

| User Persona | Corresponding Portal | Primary Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Admin/Operations Team** | Admin & Operations Portal | To manage, monitor, and control the entire ecosystem. |
| **Project Manager** | Project Manager Dashboard | To ensure seamless project execution, on-time and on-budget. |
| **Homeowner/Customer** | Customer Portal | To track progress, make payments, and communicate with the team. |
| **Interior Designer** | Interior Partner Portal | To manage leads, design projects, procure materials, and track earnings. |
| **Vendor/Supplier** | Vendor Portal | To manage product catalogs, inventory, and fulfill orders. |

## 5. Technology Stack & Architecture Recommendations

To compete with Livspace, the platform must be modern, scalable, and reliable.

| Component | Recommended Technology | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | React.js / Next.js, TypeScript | Industry standard for creating fast, interactive, and maintainable user interfaces. |
| **Mobile Apps** | React Native / Flutter | Allows for cross-platform development (iOS/Android) from a single codebase, accelerating time-to-market. |
| **Backend** | Node.js (Express/NestJS) or Python (Django/FastAPI) | Excellent for building scalable, real-time APIs. Microservices architecture is recommended for long-term scalability. |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL (for relational data), MongoDB (for flexible data like BOQs/designs) | A hybrid approach provides both data integrity (for users, payments) and flexibility (for project details). |
| **Cloud & DevOps** | AWS / Google Cloud / Azure | Provides scalable infrastructure (EC2/VMs, S3/Cloud Storage, RDS), serverless functions (Lambda), and robust DevOps tools. |
| **Key Integrations** | - **Payment:** Razorpay / Stripe <br> - **Communication:** Twilio / MSG91 (SMS/Email) <br> - **Analytics:** Google Analytics, Metabase | Use trusted third-party services to handle specialized functions. |
